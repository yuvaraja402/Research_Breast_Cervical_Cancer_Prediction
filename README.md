# Research (Master's Thesis)
## Predictive analysis on factors causing Breast and Cervical cancers in a woman :woman: using supervised learning with ensemble learning techniques and data mining algorithms.

Research <b>Motivation :thought_balloon: - <i>"Till what extent does Age unquestionably become the reason behind woman's :woman: breast and cervical cancer occcurences using ensemble learning?"</b></i>

Research <b>Objective :dart: - <i>To develop a model to predict with better accuracy and minimal error to reduce :chart_with_downwards_trend: deaths caused from breast and cervical cancer.</i></b>

### Implementation Overview : 
  1. Breast and cervical datasets gathered from kaggle 
  2. Performed Data cleaning, wrangling, predictvie analysis in Python.
  3. Python libraries used - 
      1. <b>Numpy</b> for storing data into arrays
      2. <b>Pandas</b> for processing data into dataframes
      3. <b>Matplotlib</b> for rudimentry visualization
      4. <b>Sklearn</b> for data mining and machine models
      5. <b>Seaborn</b> for visualizing correlation matrix and results.
  
### Models Implemented :
  1. Artificial Neural Networks  
  2. Logistic regression
  3. K nearest Neighbors
  4. Decision Trees
  5. Random Forest
  6. Ensemble learner model

### Results :
  1. Attained accurate predictions of 92% :bar_chart: with data mining algorithms and 96% :bar_chart: with ensemble learning techniques.
  2. Analysis showed red meat :meat_on_bone: consumption of 38% and alcohol :beer: consumption of 23% lead to risk of cancer cells development in women.
