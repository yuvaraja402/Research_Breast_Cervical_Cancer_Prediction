## Research (Master's Thesis Work)
# Analysis and Prediction of factors affecting Breast and Cervical cancer using Ensemble Techniques

Research <b>Motivation - <i>"Till what extent does age and gender unquestionably become the reason behind women's breast and cervical cancer occcurences using ensemble learners?"</b></i>

Research <b>Objective - <i>To develop a method t predict with betetr accuracy and less error to minimize deaths caused from breast and cervical cancer.</i></b>

Overview of Implementation - 
  1. Breast and cervical datasets from kaggle 
  2. Performed Data cleaning, wrangling, analysis and Predictive modelling in Python.
  3. Use of libraries - numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn and seaborn.
  
Models Implemented-
  1. Artificial Neural Networks  
  2. Logistic regression
  3. K nearest Neighbour
  4. Decision Trees
  5. Random Forest
  6. Ensemble learner model
