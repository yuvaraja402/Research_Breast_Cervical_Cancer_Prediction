# Research (Master's Thesis)
## Predictive analysis on factors causing Breast and Cervical cancers in a woman using supervised learning with ensemble learning techniques and data mining algorithms.

Research <b>Motivation - <i>"Till what extent does Age and Gender unquestionably become the reason behind woman's breast and cervical cancer occcurences using ensemble learning?"</b></i>

Research <b>Objective - <i>To develop a model to predict with better accuracy and minimal error to reduce deaths caused from breast and cervical cancer.</i></b>
